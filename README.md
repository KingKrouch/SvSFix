| Custom Framelimiter Operating on Display Refresh Rate Factors _(Full, Half, 1/3rd, Quarter)_.<br> **This will have less consequences for input latency (compared to VSync intervals higher than 1),<br>while not being as crappy for non-VRR displays as hardcoded 30/60/120 limits.** | âœ“ _(Experimental)_                                                                                                                           |T

**NOTE:** The plan is to have all of these features implemented to my own personal satisfaction by the time a stable 1.0 non-alpha release happens.
<br>I can't say whether or not some of these features will make the cut for when I plan to port the changes in this mod to the IL2CPP version of the game.

## Installation Instructions:
- Grab the latest release of SvSFix from [here](https://github.com/KingKrouch/SvSFix/releases) alongside with the mono runtimes for the game.
- Extract the .zip archive's contents into the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**steamapps\common\Neptunia Sisters VS Sisters**" for Steam).
- To adjust any settings open the config file located in **\BepInEx\Config\SvSFix.cfg**

## Compilation Notes (For Content AssetBundle):
If you want to do any content related modifications, or to use Unity's performance profiling tools, make sure to install Unity 2021.2.5f1 through [Unity's Download Archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive).

## Linux and Steam Deck Notes:
If you are playing on Linux or the Steam Deck, you will need to adjust the game's launch options through the game properties on Steam.

You will need to append this to the beginning of the game's launch options before playing: ```WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%```
